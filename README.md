## Welcome

Hi there, thank you very much for being here.

This is my very own set of components I've built, either for my own
delight, or to be used in one of my projects.

I've put my heart here and I do hope someone can make good usage of it - for
learning or productivity purposes - as much as I did (actually still do).

You will see that the components are organized in a quite interesting structure,
inspired in the book [_Atomic Design_](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), by
[Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost).

Helpful feedbacks are totally appreciated.

This is (and it might always be) an ongoing work, since I will keep adding,
changing, upgrading, improving and fixing components as they go live in my own
applications.

Checkout our docs at [our Github Page](https://cheesebit.github.io/ui).
