## Welcome

Hi there, thank you very much for being here.

This is my very own library of components I'm building for my own
delight and/or to be used in one of my projects.

I've put my heart here and I do hope someone can make good use of it - for
learning or productivity purposes - as much as I did (actually still do).

You will see that the components are organized in a quite interesting structure,
inspired in the book [_Atomic Design_](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), by
[Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost).

Helpful feedbacks are totally appreciated.

This is (and it might always be) an ongoing work, since I will keep adding,
changing, upgrading, improving and fixing components as they go live in my own
applications.

Checkout our docs and demo [here](https://ui.cheesebit.io).

## Head-scratching that are/were...

### ... solved
1. Functions provided as reducer for `useReducer` is called twice due to development behavior of Strict mode. Since it canâ€™t automatically detect side effects, it tries to help you to spot them by intentionally double-invoking functions like `useState`, `useMemo`, or `useReduce` (among others) [as per React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects) . You can check the discussion [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16295).

### ... still open 
1. [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) is indeed a very helpful tool when it comes to unit testing React components, but it's still unclear for me how to test things such as screen resize, dimension related tests. HoCs like [`ResizeWatcher`](https://github.com/cheesebit/ui/tree/master/src/hocs/resize-watcher) and [`OverflowWatcher`](https://github.com/cheesebit/ui/tree/master/src/hocs/overflow-watcher)are still pending to be properly unit-tested.
